# Takeoff-and-Landing-controller-for-PX4-Fixed-wing-aircraft

Here is presented a modified version of the PX4 firmware that includes a new controller for take-off and landing for fixed-wing aircraft.
The controller has been tested under the Software in the Loop simulation for the plane model. We also changed the native plane with a Bixler model that already includes some of its real parameters.
